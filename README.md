## Data Structures

1. **Arrays**
   - **Definition**: A collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - **Use Cases**: Efficient for random access and modification of elements.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - **Definition**: An algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
   - **Use Cases**: Often applied in optimization problems.

3. **Strings**
   - **Definition**: Sequences of characters used to represent text.
   - **Use Cases**: Commonly used in text processing and manipulation.

4. **Heaps**
   - **Definition**: Specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property.
   - **Use Cases**: Used in priority queues and sorting algorithms.

5. **Sliding Window**
   - **Definition**: A technique used to solve problems by maintaining a window of elements.
   - **Use Cases**: Often applied in string and array problems.

6. **2 Pointers**
   - **Definition**: A technique used to solve problems by maintaining two pointers.
   - **Use Cases**: Commonly used in array and linked list problems.

7. **Binary Search**
   - **Definition**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
   - **Use Cases**: Used in databases and file systems for fast lookup.

8. **Math**
   - **Definition**: Mathematical concepts used in algorithms.
   - **Use Cases**: Essential for solving problems involving numerical computations.

    - **Definition**: A linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
    - **Use Cases**: Useful for dynamic memory allocation.

11. **Stacks**
    - **Definition**: A linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle.
    - **Use Cases**: Used in parsing and evaluating postfix expressions.

13. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
    - **Definition**: A traversal algorithm used to search tree or graph data structures.
    - **Use Cases**: Used in finding connected components and topological sorting.

14. **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
    - **Definition**: A traversal algorithm used to search tree or graph data structures.
    - **Use Cases**: Used in finding shortest paths and network traversal.

15. **Binary Trees**
    - **Definition**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
    - **Use Cases**: Used in file systems and database indexing.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: An algorithm that selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the input into several parts and then combines the results.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
- **Linear Search**: A simple algorithm that checks each element of a list until a match is found.

### String Matching Algorithms
- **KNP Algorithm**: A string searching algorithm that uses the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the ability to shift the pattern along the text can be determined by the previously matched characters.
