        "# Core Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Overlapping Subproblems:\n",
        "#    - A problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, some of which are repeated multiple times.\n",
        "#    - Dynamic programming excels when these subproblems overlap.\n",
        "#    - Avoid redundant computations by storing the solutions to subproblems and reusing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Optimal Substructure:\n",
        "#    - An optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.\n",
        "#    - This property ensures that if we find optimal solutions for subproblems, combining them will give an optimal solution to the original problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Memoization (Top-Down): [recurrsion based approach]\n",
        "#    - Solve the problem recursively.\n",
        "#    - Store the results of subproblems in a cache (e.g., dictionary or array).\n",
        "#    - Before solving a subproblem, check the cache. If the result is present, return it directly. Otherwise, compute it, store it in the cache, and then return it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up): [loop based approach] + [can be optimized in terms of space]\n",
        "#    - Create a table to store the results of subproblems.\n",
        "#    - Fill the table iteratively, starting with the base cases (smallest subproblems).\n",
        "#    - Use the results of previously solved subproblems to compute the solutions for larger subproblems.\n",
        "\n",
        "# General Steps for Solving a DP Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Identify Overlapping Subproblems:\n",
        "#    - Analyze the problem and look for recursive relationships where the same subproblems are encountered multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Define the State:\n",
        "#    - Determine the parameters that uniquely define a subproblem (e.g., index, length, capacity).\n",
        "#    - The state is used as keys in the memoization table or indices in the tabulation table.\n",
        "# 3. Formulate the Recurrence Relation:\n",
        "#    - Express the optimal solution for a given state in terms of the optimal solutions to smaller subproblems.\n",
        "#    - This relation defines how the problem's solution is constructed from the solutions to its subproblems.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Identify Base Cases:\n",
        "#    - Define the simplest subproblems with known solutions.\n",
        "#    - These serve as the starting points for both memoization and tabulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Choose a Method (Memoization or Tabulation):\n",
        "#    - Memoization is easier to code for problems with complex dependencies between subproblems.\n",
        "#    - Tabulation can sometimes be more efficient because there's no function call overhead.\n",
